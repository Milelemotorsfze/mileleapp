# PDI Completion Notification System

## Overview
This system automatically sends email notifications to sales persons when PDI (Pre-Delivery Inspection) is completed for a vehicle.

## Features
- Automatic email notification when PDI is completed
- Professional email template with vehicle details
- Sales person identification through Sales Order (SO) relationship
- Error handling to prevent disruption of main workflow

## Implementation Details

### Files Added/Modified

1. **Email Notification Class**: `app/Mail/PDICompletionNotification.php`
   - Handles email composition and sending
   - Uses professional email template

2. **Email Template**: `resources/views/emails/pdi-completion-notification.blade.php`
   - Responsive HTML email template
   - Displays vehicle details, PDI completion date, and pickup information

3. **Controller Updates**:
   - `app/Http/Controllers/VehiclePicturesController.php` - Added notification when PDI pictures are uploaded
   - `app/Http/Controllers/ApprovalsController.php` - Added notification when PDI is approved

4. **Test Command**: `app/Console/Commands/TestPDINotification.php`
   - Allows testing of notification functionality

### How It Works

1. **PDI Picture Upload**: When PDI pictures are uploaded via `VehiclePicturesController`, the system:
   - Sets `pdi_date` to current timestamp
   - Loads vehicle with sales person relationship
   - Sends notification email to sales person

2. **PDI Approval**: When PDI is approved via `ApprovalsController`, the system:
   - Sets `pdi_date` and `pdi_remarks`
   - Loads vehicle with sales person relationship
   - Sends notification email to sales person

### Email Content

The notification email includes:
- Vehicle VIN
- Brand and Model information
- Model Year
- Exterior and Interior colors
- Current location
- PDI completion date and time
- Professional formatting with Milele branding

### Testing

To test the notification system:

```bash
php artisan test:pdi-notification {vehicle_id} {email_address}
```

Example:
```bash
php artisan test:pdi-notification 123 test@example.com
```

### Error Handling

- Email sending errors are logged but don't interrupt the main PDI completion process
- If sales person email is not available, notification is skipped
- All errors are logged to Laravel's log system

### Requirements

- Laravel Mail system must be properly configured
- Sales Order (SO) must have a valid `sales_person_id`
- Sales person must have a valid email address
- Vehicle must have proper relationships loaded

## Usage

The notification system works automatically once implemented. No additional configuration is required beyond ensuring:

1. Mail system is configured in `.env`
2. Sales persons have valid email addresses
3. Vehicles are properly linked to Sales Orders

## Troubleshooting

If notifications are not being sent:

1. Check Laravel logs for error messages
2. Verify mail configuration in `.env`
3. Ensure sales person has valid email address
4. Check that vehicle has proper SO relationship
5. Use the test command to verify functionality
